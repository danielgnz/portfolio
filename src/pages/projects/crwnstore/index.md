## Overview

Following [my previous experience](/projects/danprix) with building E-Commerce websites, this time I decided to challenge myself and create one from scratch using not the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) builder, but my Full-Stack Development knowledge.

The purpose of developing this Full-Stack application was to learn how to use Firebase and the Stripe API, as well as understanding the State Management flow provided by Redux and Redux Saga.

## Technologies
* React.js
* React Router
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* SASS
* Styled Components
* Node.js
* REST API
* Firebase
* Stripe API

## Functionality

1. Create a new account
2. Sign in
3. Sign in with Google
4. Fetching and Updating data from Firestore database
4. Browsing through product categories
5. Adding/Removing products to cart
6. Proceed to checkout
7. Make payment using Stripe API (Test Mode) 

At the moment, this project is being updated weekly, so please be reasonable when criticising it, because cooler features will be added soon.

## Future Updates

* Add Unit Tests
* Enable Progressive Web App features
* Create product pages
* Improve overall UX/UI
* Fix layout bugs
* Add featured products section
* Add *Recently Viewed Products* section

And much more! There's always room for improvement!
